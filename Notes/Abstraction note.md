### **Abstraction in JavaScript**

**Abstraction** is one of the fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It allows you to hide complex implementation details and expose only the essential features of an object. In JavaScript, abstraction is achieved by creating **classes** with public methods that provide a simplified interface for interacting with an object, while the inner workings (implementation details) are hidden.

While JavaScript does not have built-in support for abstract classes (like some other languages such as Java or C++), abstraction can be achieved through techniques like:

1. **Using ES6 Classes** with public and private fields/methods.
2. **Encapsulation** of complex logic within methods to simplify usage.

### **Example of Abstraction in JavaScript**

```javascript
class Vehicle {
  constructor(make, model) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
  }

  // Public method providing simplified functionality
  displayInfo() {
    console.log(`Vehicle: ${this.make} ${this.model}`);
    this.#startEngine(); // Calls the private method
  }

  // Private method to hide complex implementation details
  #startEngine() {
    console.log('Engine starting... All systems go!');
  }
}

// Creating an instance of the Vehicle class
const myCar = new Vehicle('Toyota', 'Corolla');

// Accessing the public method
myCar.displayInfo();

// Trying to access the private method will result in an error
// myCar.#startEngine(); // ‚ùå Error: Private field '#startEngine' must be declared in an enclosing class
```

### **Explanation of the Example**

1. **Public Method (`displayInfo`)**:
   - Provides a simple way for the user to display vehicle information and starts the engine.

2. **Private Method (`#startEngine`)**:
   - The `#` symbol makes the method private.
   - Hides the implementation details of starting the engine, preventing direct access from outside the class.

3. **Simplified Interface**:
   - The user interacts only with `displayInfo()` without needing to know how the engine starts internally.

### **Key Points**

1. **Public Methods**: Expose only essential functionality.
2. **Private Methods/Fields**: Hide complex logic or details using `#`.
3. **Purpose**: Simplifies interaction with objects and hides unnecessary complexity.
4. **Benefits**: Enhances maintainability, security, and clarity by keeping the internal workings of a class hidden.

This approach ensures that users of a class only focus on what the class does, not how it does it.
