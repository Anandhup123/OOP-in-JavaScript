### Problem:
Create a class `BankAccount` in JavaScript that demonstrates the concept of abstraction.

**Requirements:**
1. The class should allow creating an account with an initial balance.
2. It should include:
   - A **public method** to deposit money into the account.
   - A **public method** to check the account balance.
   - A **private method** to validate that the deposit amount is positive.
3. The private validation method should not be accessible outside the class.
4. Demonstrate the use of the public methods to deposit money and check the account balance.

Write the implementation of the `BankAccount` class and demonstrate its usage.
